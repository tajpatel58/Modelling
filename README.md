## Playground Repository:

Here is a repo that I use for random mini notebook projects where my goal is to:

- Learn about various types of models in different domains. 
- Develop feature engineering techniques. 
- Generate more interesting plots. 
- Have fun with data! :) 

### Credit Card Fraud Detection: 

**Scope:** Creating a model to detect fraudulent banking transactions from an unbalanced (1% Fraudulent) dataset. 

**Techniques Used:**
- Random undersampling to generate a subset of data that is balanced. 
- PCA/T-SNE for dimension reduction to determine feasibility of modelling. 
- MlFlow to log models/hyper-parameters and move models into model registry.
